# AMA-App (Next.js)

A Next.js AMA-style web application — built while learning Next.js by following a tutorial by Hitesh Choudhary.

## 🚀 About

This project is inspired by Hitesh Choudhary’s YouTube tutorial. I’m using this app to learn Next.js concepts and build a real-world web application at the same time. It’s a personal fork/clone of the original “ama-app,” and I’ll be updating and extending it as I progress.
